Welcome to the Palindrome Inspector! This project is a simple Java-based REST API that checks whether a given text is a palindrome or not.


A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, such as "madam" or "civic." The Palindrome Inspector API accepts requests containing a username and text value and returns whether the provided text is a palindrome. It also includes features like caching and persistence of processed values.

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) (Optional, as the project includes the Gradle Wrapper)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (Optional, for the purposes of submitting your input and examining the cached data)
